function [maxLoad] = actualLoad(W)
    %actualLoad computes the largest load any of the support poles would
    %  need to bear based on the distribution of forces in the W matrix. We
    %  assume each pole is solely responsible for the forces in its
    %  quadrant.
    %     W: Weights matrix (Distribution of weight on the roof)
    %      
    %     maxLoad: the largest load among any of the four support poles
